# WildcardRoll
A automatic roll bot for the wow private server project ascension. It works fully *automaticly* and with the ascension client in the background, so you can do *other stuff on your computer while rolling*. Please note that even though nobody got banned yet, using this software is **against the code of conduct** of project ascension and **may lead to a permantent ban**. Use it at your **own risk**!

### Downloading

Releases of the software can be found on the [release section](https://github.com/RekzaiSharp/WildcardRoll/releases).

### How to use?

Just extract and start the app (doesn't have to be in the addon folder of wow), select the abilities you want to roll for and put the following macro on key 0 (zero):
```
/use Dice of Destiny
/use Hearthstone
/stopcasting
/click StaticPopup1Button1
```
Now press the "Roll!" button and you are good to go.
